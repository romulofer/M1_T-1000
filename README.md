# M1 T-1000 Firmware

**T-1000** is a custom, feature-expanded firmware for the [Monstatek M1](https://monstatek.com) handheld multi-tool — Sub-GHz, NFC, RFID, Infrared, WiFi, Bluetooth, and BadUSB in one device — with its own UI, tooling, and hardware-mod support layered on top of the M1 platform.

> **This is an independent community project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Monstatek.**

## Features

- **Wireless DuckyScript** — same scripting as BadUSB but over Bluetooth HID
- Pairs with target device wirelessly, no cable needed

> **Note:** Bad-BT is under active development and may not work reliably on all target devices. Bluetooth pairing and keystroke delivery depend on the target's BLE HID support.

### External Apps
- **ELF app loader** — load and run third-party apps from SD card
- Browse and launch `.m1app` files from the Apps menu
- Download ready-to-use apps and the App SDK at **[m1-sdk](https://github.com/bedge117/m1-sdk)**

- View device info and connection details
- **BLE Spam** — flood Apple / Google / Microsoft "device nearby" advertisements
  (vendor selectable: All / Apple / Google / Microsoft)

### Dual Boot
- Two firmware banks with safe boot validation
- Swap between banks from the menu or via the companion app
- CRC verification before boot — falls back to working bank on corruption

### RGB Backlight

- **Color, animation, and brightness** control — Static, Breathe, Color Cycle, Strobe, and Fade effects
- **Custom color editor** — dial in an exact R/G/B color, saved to SD
- **Reactive lighting** — color follows live system state: battery level (green → amber → red), a pulse while charging, and a flash on notifications

- **Reactive Backlight** — drives the RGB mod from live system state: battery level (green/amber/red), charging pulse (blue), and notification flash (white)
- **Animated main-menu logo** — the M1 owl idly bounces DVD-screensaver style in its panel, then slides off and returns on a loop; cosmetic only, any keypress restores the static menu

## Companion App

**[M1 T-800](https://github.com/dagnazty/M1-T-800)** — Desktop companion app for Windows. Connect your M1 via USB to:

- View device info, battery status, firmware version
- Flash firmware updates over USB
- Flash via DFU mode (works with stock firmware)
- Mirror the M1's screen on your PC
- Browse and manage SD card files
- Manage WiFi networks
- Update the ESP32 coprocessor firmware

Download the latest release from the [M1 T-800 releases page](https://github.com/dagnazty/M1-T-800/releases).

## IR Remote Database

The [`ir_database/`](ir_database/) directory contains pre-built infrared remote files for popular devices. Copy them to `IR/` on the M1's SD card to use with the Universal Remote feature.

Includes remotes for: Samsung, LG, Sony, Philips, Panasonic, Vizio, TCL, Hisense, Toshiba, Sharp, Bose, Denon, and universal power codes.

All files use the Flipper Zero `.ir` format — you can also use IR files from the [Flipper IRDB](https://github.com/Lucaslhm/Flipper-IRDB) community database.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- **STM32CubeIDE 1.17+** (recommended), or
- **ARM GCC 14.2+** with CMake and Ninja
- **Python 3** (for post-build CRC injection)

### Build with CMake

```bash
# One-command build
./build.sh
```

`build.sh` will try to auto-discover:
- a complete `arm-none-eabi-gcc` toolchain
- `cmake`
- `ninja`

On macOS it prefers STM32CubeIDE's bundled ARM toolchain over partial Homebrew
installs that are missing the embedded C library. You can still override the
compiler path explicitly:

```bash
export ARM_GCC_BIN=/path/to/arm-gnu-toolchain/bin
./build.sh
```

If you want to run CMake manually instead, use:

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

If CMake finds `arm-none-eabi-gcc` but compilation immediately fails on
`stdint.h`, `string.h`, or `math.h`, the compiler was installed without the
Arm embedded C library/sysroot. On macOS this can happen with a partial
Homebrew toolchain. Point `ARM_GCC_BIN` at a complete Arm GNU toolchain that
includes the `arm-none-eabi` headers and libraries.

### Build with STM32CubeIDE

Open the project directory in STM32CubeIDE and build.

### Build with Make (Linux)

```bash
make
```

Output: `./artifacts/`

### GitHub Actions

The workflow at `.github/workflows/firmware-release.yml` builds the firmware on
pull requests and pushes, then uploads the contents of `artifacts/` as a GitHub
Actions artifact.

Pushing a version tag such as `v0.1.1` also creates a GitHub Release and
attaches the built firmware files, checksums, and a zip bundle. The pushed tag
must match `T1000_VERSION_*` in `m1_csrc/m1_t1000_version.h`.

You can also run the workflow manually from the Actions tab with
`workflow_dispatch`. If you enable `create_release`, the workflow will publish a
release for the current commit using the matching firmware version tag.

## Flashing

### Via M1 T-800 (recommended)
Connect via USB and use the Firmware Update page in [M1 T-800](https://github.com/dagnazty/M1-T-800).

### Via DFU Mode (recovery / first install)
1. Power off the M1 (Settings > Power > Power Off > Right Button)
2. Hold **Up + OK** for 5 seconds to enter DFU mode (screen stays dark)
3. Connect via USB-C
4. Use the DFU Flash page in [M1 T-800](https://github.com/dagnazty/M1-T-800)

To exit DFU mode without flashing, hold **Right + Back** to reboot.

### Via SWD
Use an ST-Link or J-Link debugger with STM32CubeIDE or OpenOCD.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or pull request.

If you're building a companion app or tool that communicates with the M1, the RPC protocol is implemented in `m1_csrc/m1_rpc.c` and `Core/Src/cli_app.c`.
